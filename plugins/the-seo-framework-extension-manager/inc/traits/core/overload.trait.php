/**
 * Legend/Definitions:
 *
 * - Facade Legend/Definitions:
 *      Choose one per trait.
 *
 *      - Core: Final instance.
 *         - No parents.
 *         - Maybe children.
 *         - All methods are protected.
 *
 *      - Master: First instance of facade. Calls all the shots.
 *         - Expects parent class.
 *         - Has no child class.
 *         - All methods are public.
 *            - Except for subconstructor.
 *         - Expects class to be labelled "final".
 *
 *      - Sub: Sub instance.
 *         - Expects child class.
 *         - Expects parent class.
 *
 *      - Child: Child instance.
 *         - Synonymous to "static".
 *         - Expects parent class.
 *         - Could have child class.
 *         - Prevents object calling.
 *
 *      - Stray: Expects nothing.
 *         - Maybe child.
 *         - Maybe parent.
 *
 * - Visibility Legend/Definitions:
 *      These can be combined.
 *
 *      - Final: Final instance.
 *         - Expects children classes not to contain same methods.
 *         - All methods are labelled "final".
 *         - Expects class to be labelled "final".
 *
 *      - Solo: Single object.
 *         - Expects no parents.
 *         - Expects no children.
 *         - All methods are labelled "final".
 *         - Expects class to be labelled "final".
 *         - Prevents facade pattern.
 *         - All methods could be public.
 *
 *      - Static: Expects class not to be initiated.
 *         - Synonymous to "child".
 *         - Prevents object calling.
 *         - All public methods are static.
 *
 *      - Once: Expects class to be called at most once.
 *         - Caches method calls.
 *         - Exits PHP on second call.
 *
 *      - Interface: Contains abstract methods.
 *
 *      - Private: All methods are private.
 *
 *      - <No keyword>: Expects nothing.
 *         - All methods are "protected".
 *
 *      - Public: All methods are public.
 *
 * - Type Legend/Definitions:
 *      Choose one per trait.
 *
 *      - Enclose: Prevents common hacking methods through magic method nullification.
 *
 *      - Construct: Holds constructor.
 *         - When interface: Holds subsconstructor.
 *            - Make sure the subconstructor is private. Otherwise late static binding will kick in.
 *
 *      - Destruct: Holds destructor and keeps track of destruct calling.
 *
 *      - Ignore_Properties_Core_Public_Final: Ignores invalid property calling. Prevents PHP warning messages.
 *
 *      - <No keyword>: Should not exist.
