= 2.5.0 - Quick SEO =

**Release date:**

* February 9th, 2021

In this update, we added quick-and bulk-edit support, improved browser scripting performance, and improved various extensions. Most notably, Honeypot catches modernized spammers, Articles can now be disabled per-post, and Focus's API is vastly expanded.

**Important release notes:**

* Henceforth, Extension Manager requires **The SEO Framework v4.1.2 or higher**.
* This release brings support for WordPress v5.6's updated interface. Sorry for the delay!
* Honeypot might momentarily mark legitimate comments as spam because it looks for new anti-spam data. Please manually moderate your comment section for a few minutes after updating, and be sure to clear your site's caches directly after updating to reduce the number of false negatives significantly.
