This extension redirects attachment-page visitors back to the parent post.

## Overview

### Clean up the web

You can easily upload and manage your media, such as images, within WordPress. Most website owners use these as attachments in posts.

But, WordPress creates a new page as a placeholder for each attachment. These pages are not beneficial for most websites because your visitors won't see your initially intended context. These placeholder pages also harm SEO, as there's often no readable content attached.

With Origin, all attachment pages will redirect your visitors to the best page available, albeit the original content or the actual attachment itself.

## Usage

### Not all attachments are affected in the same way

For an attachment page to redirect a visitor to its respective page, the attachment must be uploaded via the post edit screen.

If the assigned page no longer exists or has never existed, Origin will then redirect the visitor to the attachment itself.
