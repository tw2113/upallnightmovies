This extension keeps track of your website's SEO optimizations and statistics.

## Overview

### Let us look

Maintaining a WordPress website isn't easy. Before you start, you must find a suitable theme, useful plugins, and then set them all up.

Now, you might not be wary of your website's issues and plugins conflict with the theme or each other.

This is where the Monitor services comes in. The Monitor extension looks at your website as a real visitor would--directly from our servers.
Without WordPress's obstruction, it checks if all the basics have correctly been set up.

### An inspection for WordPress

Like other web inspectors, Monitor looks for common website errors.
Unlike other web inspectors, it compares found data to your WordPress environment, with a two-phase check.

The first phase happens on our servers, where we crawl several URLs on your website to find common issues. All information we find is sent back to the Monitor extension.

The second phase happens in your dashboard, where the information is compared to your WordPress environment, like SEO settings.

This cooperation creates personalized information like no other inspector could.

### Privacy first

Monitor is a web service running on our servers.
To operate, our servers only require your website's URL and a key.

The key is generated when you first connect the Extension Manager to our API services.
This helps us validate your website's integrity, so we know it's your website contacting us.

When crawling, Monitor looks at your website as any other visitor would, or could.
And, when you disconnect your site from our services, all crawled data will be erased.

## Usage

[tsfep-bundled]

### Activate Monitor

First, you'll need to activate Monitor.

After activating the extension, you'll find a menu link displayed next to the activation button.
That link will direct you to the Monitor registration page.

### Registration

On the registration page, you'll find a privacy statement. Beneath it, you can connect your website.

When you hit the "Register" button, your site will be registered.

Your website will also automatically be enqueued for a crawl.

### Crawling

Crawling a website from our servers can take from a few seconds up to three minutes.

This is done in scheduled one-minute intervals. When many sites are in the queue, some might be moved up front at the next interval.

If you wish to enqueue a crawl, click on the "Request Crawl" button in the Control Panel.

### Updating

To receive the latest Monitor data, hit "Update Data".

If you just initiated a crawl request, you might receive outdated or incorrect data. It takes time to crawl a website, after all.
