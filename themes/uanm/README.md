Just a good solid bare starter theme for WordPress that I keep tinkering with

* 08-01-12 Added and updated slider options.
* 05-15-12 Too many changes to efficiently list
	* Just read the commit logs :)
* 03-13-12 Normalization
	* I clearly always forget to edit this with updates. Anyways. Added normalize.css instead of reset.css.
* 12-27-11 Function Change
	* Changed all instances of bloginfo() referencing the theme directory, to use get_template_directory_uri()
* 06-18-11 WordPress TwentyEleven Poke
	* Compared and contrasted this theme with TwentyEleven. Borrowed things I liked from TwentyEleven.
* 06-06-11 Added Files
	* A lot of file cleanup and indent touchup.
* 05-24-11 Added Files
	*Added custom_cms_admin.php. Full of functions and information on customizing WordPress admin for clients.
